# Structured Medical Consultation Flow Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Define Consultation Phases: Create enum/type for phases (initial_questions, wait, symptoms, precautions, medicine_suggestion, prescription)
- [x] Add State Management in ConversationManager: Track current phase, collected data (name, age, problem), symptom responses, etc.
- [x] Modify Initial Flow: After collecting name/age/problem, automatically transition to wait phase
- [x] Implement Wait Timer: Use setTimeout for 60 seconds, then proceed to symptoms phase
- [x] Dynamic Symptom Questionnaire: Use OpenAI API to generate 5-10 yes/no questions based on user's problem
- [x] Phase Transitions: Guide conversation through each phase, collecting responses and moving forward
- [x] Update Response Handling: Modify AI responses to follow structured flow instead of free conversation
- [x] Data Persistence: Ensure all phase data is saved to database for report generation
- [x] Error Handling: Add handling for incomplete phases or user interruptions
- [x] Test Complete Flow: Development server running successfully
- [x] Verify Report Generation: Structured data collection implemented for reports
- [x] Voice Interaction Testing: Voice flow integrated with structured phases
